minni
=====

Minimalistic command line todo list

Why *Minni* ? Not because of minimalistic ! *Minni* means *memory* in icelandic.


Versions
--------

* 	`0.0.1` First release, crappy but usable
	
	Be sure to have `.minni` file in the folder in which you execute *Minni*, otherwise it is going to crash with weird message
